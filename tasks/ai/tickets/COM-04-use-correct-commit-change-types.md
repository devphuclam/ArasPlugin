# COM-04 — Use correct commit change types

## Metadata

- Epic: Commit History
- Dependencies: COM-03,WSP-05
- Risk: High
- Status: Not Started

## Goal

Replace hardcoded added with diff result.

## Scope

Mapping and tests.

## Required preparation

1. Read `docs/ai/01_AI_RUNBOOK.md`.
2. Read `docs/ai/02_PROJECT_STATE.md`.
3. Read `docs/ai/03_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`.
4. Read `docs/ai/04_ARAS_SCHEMA_MAP.md` when Aras-related.
5. Verify dependencies are merged.
6. Start from a clean working tree.

## Acceptance criteria

Added/modified/deleted/renamed map correctly; unknown fails safely.

In addition:

- Build/test evidence is recorded.
- No false-success path is introduced.
- No secret is logged or committed.
- Cancellation and rollback are addressed where applicable.
- Reviewer BLOCKER/HIGH findings are resolved.

## Non-goals

No restore feature.

## AI stop conditions

Stop and report `BLOCKED` if:

- a required Aras logical name or permission is not confirmed;
- the ticket requires destructive data changes not specified here;
- implementation needs more than two major modules or about 15 files;
- a baseline build/test failure prevents verification;
- a dependency ticket is not merged.

## Required final report

- Behavior before/after.
- Files changed.
- Commands and outputs.
- Acceptance criteria mapping.
- Schema/manual test impact.
- Remaining limitations/follow-ups.
